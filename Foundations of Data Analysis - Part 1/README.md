# Course Description
In this first of a two part course, we will cover basic Descriptive Statistics – learning about visualizing and summarizing data, followed by a “Modeling” investigation where we’ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We will learn how to interpret and use those functions with basic Pre-Calculus. These two “units” will set the learner up nicely for the second part of the course: Inferential Statistics with a multiple regression cap.

Both parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).

This course will consist of:

- Instructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics.
- Guided questions to help your understanding of the topic.
- Weekly tutorial videos for using R
- Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets.
- Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge.
